## Presentation
<p>
Blog-Writer is a website presenting a blog template for a writer who regularly publishes articles, or chapters of his stories. The site is based on a Jquery frontend and a PHP / MySQL backend, with an MVC architecture, storing articles, comments and user accounts. It is possible from a backoffice to write new articles and to comment on articles when connected, via an editor based on TinyMCE.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to access the administrator area and create new articles with the username / password: Jean Forteroche / Jean Forteroche.

</p>
<p>
This project is an initiative resulting from my validation of knowledge carried out on Openclassrooms in 2018.

</p>

Realized in June 2018.
